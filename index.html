						<h2>Are your federal elected representatives doing their job well?</h2>
						<p>Recent reelection rates for incumbent candidates in both the US Senate and House of Representatives are over 90%. Incumbent candidates have several advantages, such as fundraising potential, name recognition, and representing the status quo. During election cycles, we learn about candidates through campaign ads and news. However, once the election is over, it's difficult to follow up and see if they're living up to expectations.</p>
                        <p>Incumbency should not be a golden ticket to reelection; and the lack of an upcoming election should not grant freedom from scrutiny. By combining data from public sources and producing easy-to-use and easy-to-understand visualizations and summaries, we provide constituents with information to help make informed decisions about whether or not the status quo is worth maintaining.</p>

						<h3>Bulk Processing</h3>
						<p>It all starts with a Python script that downloads detailed information about all bills created in either the Senate or House of Representatives going back to the 113th Congress. For each bill, we extract the main topic, sponsors and cosponsors, evaluate the sponsorship in terms of bipartisan support, and assign a score based on how far the bill progressed through the legislative process. These findings for each bill are aggregated at the individual representative level, allowing us to compare representatives to each other.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Personalized Results</h3>
                        <p>Because this tool is meant to allow an individual to evaluate their own representatives, we need to know which representatives to display. We do this by running the user's address through the Google Civic Information API, which gives the names of each of the three federal representatives applicable for that address. These results are used to determine the appropriate unique IDs to use for ProPublica's data. Because names are not guaranteed to be unique and sometimes appear somewhat differently, the connection between Google's data and ProPublica's data is established by matching a combination of the representative's first and last name, Twitter handle, YouTube username, and Facebook username.</p>

                        <h3>Django</h3>
                        <p>The Political Insights tool was developed in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, a Python-based web framework. Visualizations and key datapoints are generated on-demand once the user enters their address and selects the metric they'd like to examine. This is accomplished by utilizing a combination of API calls and pre-processed bulk data.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Effectiveness</h3>
                        <p>The results we provide in the tool are straightforward, but the concept of "legislative effectiveness" warrants explanation. A bill becomes a law by progressing through the following steps:
                        <ol>
							<li>Intoduction</li>
							<li>Referred to committee</li>
							<li>Recommended out of committee</li>
							<li>Passed in the originating chamber</li>
							<li>Passed in the other chamber</li>
                            <li>Any changes reconciled if versions were not identical</li>
                            <li>Signed by the President</li>
						</ol>
                        ProPublica's data includes every status a bill has attained, which we use to determine how far along that process the bill progressed. Every bill is scored based on that progress, and then the sponsors and cosponsors of that bill have the bill's score factored into their overall effectiveness calculation. When these scores are compared to determine rankings, it allows us to say that Senator X is more effective than Senator Y because bills sponsored by X tend to make it farther along in the process than those sponsored by Y.</p>
